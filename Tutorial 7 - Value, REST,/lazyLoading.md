# Lazy loading

## How you can implement on the uow database

To implement lazy loading patterns in the given example, you can follow these steps:

### 1. Lazy Initialization:

Modify the Document class to delay the loading of its contents. This approach assumes that loading the contents is not resource-heavy.

    public class Document {
    // ...
    private String contents;
    private boolean isContentsLoaded = false;
    // ...
    
        public String getContents() {
            System.out.println("Getting contents");
            if (!isContentsLoaded) {
                contents = backingDatabase.getDocumentContents(this.id);
                isContentsLoaded = true;
            }
            return contents;
        }
        // ...
    }
    
### 2. Virtual Proxy:

Create a separate class DocumentProxy that implements the same interface as Document and acts as a proxy.


    public interface DocumentInterface {
    int getID();
    String getContents();
    void setContents(String contents);
    void appendToContents(String append);
    }
    
    public class Document implements DocumentInterface {
    // ... Implement the interface methods ...
    }
    
    public class DocumentProxy implements DocumentInterface {
    private int id;
    private Document realDocument;
    // ...
    
        public DocumentProxy(int id, SlowDatabase backingDatabase, UowDriver uowDriver) {
            this.id = id;
            this.backingDatabase = backingDatabase;
            this.uowDriver = uowDriver;
        }
    
        private void initializeRealDocument() {
            if (realDocument == null) {
                realDocument = new Document(id, backingDatabase, uowDriver);
            }
        }
    
        // Implement DocumentInterface methods, and call `initializeRealDocument()` when needed
    }

### 3. Value Holder:

Create a separate DocumentValueHolder class to handle object creation and maintain a reference to the actual object.

    public class DocumentValueHolder {
    private int id;
    private SlowDatabase backingDatabase;
    private UowDriver uowDriver;
    private Document document;
    
        public DocumentValueHolder(int id, SlowDatabase backingDatabase, UowDriver uowDriver) {
            this.id = id;
            this.backingDatabase = backingDatabase;
            this.uowDriver = uowDriver;
        }
    
        private void loadDocument() {
            if (document == null) {
                document = new Document(id, backingDatabase, uowDriver);
            }
        }
    
        // Implement methods that operate on the Document, calling `loadDocument()` when needed
    }

### 4. Ghost:

Modify the Document class to only load partial content initially, and load more content when required.

    public class Document {
    // ...
    private String contents;
    private boolean isFullContentsLoaded = false;
    // ...
    
        public String getContents() {
            System.out.println("Getting contents");
            if (!isFullContentsLoaded) {
                contents = backingDatabase.getDocumentContentsPartial(this.id); // Load partial content
                isFullContentsLoaded = true;
            }
            return contents;
        }
    
        public void loadFullContents() {
            if (!isFullContentsLoaded) {
                contents = backingDatabase.getDocumentContents(this.id); // Load full content
                isFullContentsLoaded = true;
            }
        }
        // ...
}

Depending on the specific use case, you can choose one or a combination of these patterns to optimize the performance of your database access.

## Why should you use it?

In the given context, implementing lazy loading patterns can provide several benefits:

    Reduced initial loading time: Since the contents of the documents are not loaded immediately when the Document objects are created, the initial loading time will be reduced. This is particularly useful when dealing with a large number of documents, where loading all contents at once might be slow and resource-intensive.

    Improved resource utilization: Loading contents only when needed can save memory and processing resources, as not all contents are stored in memory at once. This is especially important when working with a slow database or when memory is a constraint.

    Better response times: When accessing a specific document, the user only has to wait for that document's contents to load, rather than waiting for all documents' contents to load. This can result in faster response times for users, improving the overall user experience.

    Scalability: Lazy loading patterns can help maintain performance as the number of documents grows. By loading contents only when needed, the application can better handle large data sets without running into performance issues.

    Separation of concerns: By implementing patterns like Virtual Proxy or Value Holder, you can decouple the object creation/loading logic from the main application logic. This can make the code easier to understand, maintain, and test.

In the given context, these benefits can be particularly helpful as the SlowDatabase simulates a slow and potentially resource-intensive environment. Implementing lazy loading patterns can help ensure that the application remains performant and responsive even in such a scenario.
